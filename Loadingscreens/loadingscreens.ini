[SCP-005]
image path = 005.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s.
text2 = SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock, be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.
text3 = While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability.

[SCP-009]
image path = 009.jpg
align x = right
align y = top
disablebackground = true
text1 =  SCP-009 is approximately 3,700 liters of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, are as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue.
text2 = Its most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H2O: the subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure.
text3 = If the subject comes in contact with any biological source of heat, it begins a runaway reaction in which the living organism's bodily fluids are rapidly converted to SCP-009 and promptly frozen by their own body heat (because of their generally high core temperatures, mammals are particularly susceptible).

[SCP-012]

image path = 012.jpg

align x = right

align y = top

disablebackground = true

text1 = SCP-012 was retrieved by Archaeologist K.M. Sandoval during the excavation of a northern Italian tomb. The object, a piece of handwritten musical score entitled "On Mount Golgotha", appears to be incomplete.

text2 = The red/black ink, first thought to be some form of berry or natural dye ink, was later found to be human blood from multiple subjects.

text3 = Multiple test subjects have been allowed access to the score. In every case, the subjects mutilated themselves in order to use their own blood to finish the piece, resulting in subsequent symptoms of psychosis and massive trauma.

[SCP-038]
image path = 038.jpg
align x = right
align y = bottom
text1=SCP-038 was at first thought to be a common apple tree. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that SCP-038 was growing things other than apples and, in fact, other than fruit.
text2=SCP-038 has the ability to clone any object that touches its bark. Objects begin growing almost instantaneously and reach maturity within a matter of minutes.
text3=Human and animal cloning through SCP-038 is not recommended, as they appear to age quickly. The majority of these clones live, on average, two (2) weeks.

[SCP-148]
image path = 148.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-148 is a metallic substance, composed of a variety of known and unknown elements. 
text2 = SCP-148 has shown the ability to block or otherwise hinder extrasensory mind-affecting properties of living organisms in proximity to it.
text3 = This effect, while difficult to quantify, appears inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the subject to SCP-148’s surface and directly proportional to the quantity of SCP-148 in consideration.

[SCP-409]
image path = 409.jpg
align x = center
align y = bottom
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-409 resembles a large quartz crystal approximately 1.5m (5ft) tall and 0.6m (2ft) wide.
text2 = Any objects coming in contact with SCP-409 will begin to crystallize.
text3 = After complete crystallization, the object will begin to make snapping and creaking noises for approximately twenty minutes, before bursting into thousands of fragments with great force.

[SCP-1074]
image path = 1074.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-1074 is a portrait-sized oil painting on canvas, produced by an unidentified artist. When photographed or videotaped, the entirety of SCP-1074 appears to be painted a uniform shade of gray, with distinctly visible brush strokes.
text2 = When SCP-1074 is viewed by a human being, the observer immediately begins to exhibit physiological symptoms similar to the onset of Stendhal syndrome, including increased heart rate, sweating, and vertigo.
text3 = The individual viewing SCP-1074 will attempt to vividly describe the image they are seeing to anyone present, frequently describing it as the greatest or most moving work of art they have ever seen.
